Globalization and the free market philosophy, the forces that shaped our present economy, are creating new customer demands and needs, thereby challenging organizations to raise their performance. It is logical that the ensuing competition is compelling organizations to develop products and services faster, cheaper, and better in order to maintain or increase competitive advantage in the global market place. Further, these global forces are impacting the way we manage projects. However, history shows that globalization and the free market philosophy are not new; what has changed is the availability of advanced technology systems and their extensive application for managing projects effectively.

With a steep decline in communication and Internet access costs, information technology and access to virtual world networks are encouraging organizations to shift toward decentralized and networked structures. With the ever-expanding use of the World Wide Web, organizations realize advantages in time management, travel costs, and communications speed (Lee-Kelly, 2006). Further, organizations are in a position to use talented people from almost anywhere in the world at a lower cost. Employing virtual teams to manage business has become an important option because organizations are able to overcome the barriers of time and geographical location (Lipnack & Stamps, 1999). Be it a product, service, or result, virtual global teams are routinely employed for managing projects.
